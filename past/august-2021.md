## LibreCAD (https://librecad.org)

LibreCAD again - recently got a large format plotter at work, so this is going to be use a lot I think.
I'm a bit worried about development, so it deserves a donation.

## vue-concise-carousel (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jambonn/vue-concise-carousel)

This got me out of a hole - a useful API, and compatible with Nuxt

## Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com)

Yarn is great - I don't know exactly why it's better than NPM, but I use it as my default anyway.
