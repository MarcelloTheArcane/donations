## Arc Welder Plugin (https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderPlugin)

This is huge.  The main problem with my Cura/OctoPrint setup is that the serial terminal can't handle curves fast enough, so a lot of models are useless.
This plugin turns Cura's straight-line-curves into G2/G3 commands (arcs), which makes curves happen at SD card speeds.
