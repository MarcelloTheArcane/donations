# September 2021

## Vetur (https://github.com/vuejs/vetur)

I didn't know how much I appreciated Vetur until I didn't have it (VSCodium install)!

## GnuGPG (https://gnupg.org)

GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard.

## VSCodium (https://vscodium.com)

FLOSS version of VSCode, without all the MS telemetry.

## STM32-base (https://stm32-base.org)

Looks like a fantastic resource for STM32 microcontrollers.  I have a rogue ~blue~green pill which I want to program.
