# June 2021

The first event, so it's a big one!  I've used a lot of things in the past, but this is just for June.

## Hasura (https://hasura.io)

A really simple and easy database that makes me dream up side projects.

## Tabliss (https://tabliss.io)

Really nice new tab page for Firefox.

## Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)

Firefox is delightful - I'm replacing Chrome wherever I can.  And their new 89 update is great, in my opinion.

## Astro (https://astro.build)

I haven't actually used this, but I really want to!  I like their no/minimal JS philosophy.

## Lichess (https://lichess.org)

A great chess engine that is completely open source!  Also there's an API which I'd like to use sometime.

## MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org)

MDN continues to be one of the best resources for web development - I've lost count how many times I've quickly looked something up, and they are a delight to use.
