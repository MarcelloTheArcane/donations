# June 2021

The first event, so it's a big one!  I've used a lot of things in the past, but this is just for June.

## Hasura (https://hasura.io)

A really simple and easy database that makes me dream up side projects.

## Tabliss (https://tabliss.io)

Really nice new tab page for Firefox.

## Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)

Firefox is delightful - I'm replacing Chrome wherever I can.  And their new 89 update is great, in my opinion.
