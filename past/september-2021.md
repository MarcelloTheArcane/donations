## ClearURLs (https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls)

This will make my browsing experience faster and less tracked!  It turns link-tracking redirect URLs into plain ones, and gets rid of ETag tracking.

## OctoPrint (https://octoprint.org)

This has featured before, it's a fantastic 3d printer management platform on Raspberry Pi.

## Arduino IDE (https://arduino.cc)

It's a very basic IDE, but it works.  I'm used to the Arduino IDE as opposed to PlatformIO, so it's my fallback.

## Marlin (https://marlinfw.org)

I've recently flashed my Creality Ender 5 3d printer with vanilla Marlin firmware, so that it can incorporate a BLTouch device.

## PlatformIO (https://platformio.org)

I'm using PlatformIO with VSCodium (PlatformIO Core, as Microsoft don't let you have the plugin) to program various MCU development boards.

## Vetur (https://github.com/vuejs/vetur)

I didn't know how much I appreciated Vetur until I didn't have it (VSCodium install)!

## GnuGPG (https://gnupg.org)

GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard.

## VSCodium (https://vscodium.com)

FLOSS version of VSCode, without all the MS telemetry.

## STM32-base (https://stm32-base.org)

Looks like a fantastic resource for STM32 microcontrollers.  I have a rogue ~blue~green pill which I want to program.
