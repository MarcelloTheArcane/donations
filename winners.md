# Winners!

## July 2021

**ArcWelderPlugin (https://github.com/FormerLurker/ArcWelderPlugin)**

ArcWelderPlugin has saved me a lot of hassle with going to my 3d printer to update the SD card for whenever I wanted curves in my prints - which is all the time.

## June 2021

**Mozilla Foundation (https://www.mozilla.org)**

Mozilla wins this month, because of Firefox _and_ MDN.  I'm loving both!
