# Donations

This repository tracks my donations to open source projects that I have found useful each month.

I'm committing to **Â£10 per month** for the one open source project that I found most helpful or interesting!

## Previous winners

See the [winners list](./winners.md) for previous winners.

## Questions

1. *Will you donate to my/this repository?*
  No, unless I have used it or think it worthy of donation.

2. *That amount isn't going to go very far...*
  Undoubtedly.  But I can't fund open source projects all by myself.  I can help though, and I think that's worth doing.
